## **Victor P.**
**Junior Software Developer**



### About Me

I have been learning programming since my entering the university. The first step I've made was beginning of using C++ while doing labs. At the moment I have the average level of this language. This fact made me "meet" C# and .NET. Then I decided to expand the area of my interests and started learning Java at which point I am pretty sure that have basic knowledge.

In my opinion, software development is the direction where I can use my professional skills - some aspects of my university speciality (infocommunication field).

Speaking of practical experience, I do not have such. I can stress a course project at my studies where I am supposed to have developed a simple web-application. For this purpose, I chose .NET technology as C# syntax is similar to C++ one.
